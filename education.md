### **<center> Types of Bets </center>**  
Moneyline: A bet on which team or player will win the game outright, regardless of the point spread.  
Point Spread: A bet on which team will win the game, taking into account a point spread that is designed to level the playing field. The favorite must win by more than the point spread for a bet on them to be successful, while the underdog must either win or lose by fewer points than the spread.  
Over/Under: A bet on whether the total score of the game or match will be over or under a certain number.  
Parlay: A bet that combines multiple wagers into a single bet. All of the bets in the parlay must be successful for the bet to win.

### **<center> Before Betting </center>**  
  
Manage your bankroll: Set a budget for how much you are willing to spend on betting and stick to it. Never bet more than you can afford to lose.  
  
Do your research: Before placing a bet, research the teams or players involved, their past performance, and any relevant statistics or trends.  
  
Bet with your head, not your heart: It's easy to get caught up in rooting for your favorite team, but don't let that cloud your judgment when placing a bet.  
  
Shop for the best odds: Different sportsbooks may offer different odds on the same event, so do your research and find the best value for your bet.  
  
Take advantage of promotions: Many sportsbooks offer promotions and bonuses to new and existing customers, so be sure to take advantage of these offers when they are available.
